In this exercise, I was asked to predict a continuous variable using a machine learning algorithm by varying the values of a hyperparameter of this algorithm. This is one of my very first experiences with the amazing world of Machine Learning and Data Science in general.

The objective is to observe the evolution of the measurement error on the training sample as well as on the test sample, according to the flexibility of the model.

The data used in this exercise give the selling price of cars (in rupees) and provide details on the characteristics of the car. These were downloaded from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/nehalbirla/vehicle-dataset-from-cardekho) and cleaned.
